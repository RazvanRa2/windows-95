# Hello, World!

My name's Razvan. I'm a computer engineering student, in Bucharest, Romania.
I'm currently interning at Microsoft, as a software engineer. Funny enough,
I'm also a Microsoft Student Partner. Guess you know why this blog is
Windows-95 themed, eh?

Now that we've got job titles and school-status out of the way, let me tell
you more about myself, in hopes that other people beside my mom (Hi, mom!) will
read this far.

## Interests

I've always been passionate about tech. I used a PC since I could barely walk.
I love writing code in C#, C++ and Java and using cloud computing resources, such
as Azure (always plug). I'm also a bit into Web Dev, but I'm only a beginner.
I *love* git and GitHub.
My favorite coding editor is Atom, and I'll talk to you for hours and hours
about why it's the best coding editor there is and about that one time I hacked
it to look at cat memes.

I like sports a lot. Particularly swimming and running, at this point and I'm
obsessed with tracking my workouts. I used to play basketball back in the day,
but that was a long time ago.
I like *some* super-heroes, particularly Deadpool and Spider-Man.
I like cats.

## What is this blog?
This is the place I sometimes write about projects Iâ€™m working on.
